For deployment the documentation available on Django's website should be followed (http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/deployment/).  The steps taken to setup the server PEANUT are as follows:

1. Install postgreSQL
2. Install python (currently 2.6)
3. Install django (currently 1.2)
4. Install django-reversion
5. Install Apache HTTP Server (currently 2.2)
6. Install mod_wsgi
7. Install win-psycopg (Had to use 2.0 since 2.2 doesn't work)
8. Install "Desktop Experience" feature on Windows 2008 Server
9. Install git and "pull" source code from http://github.com/karimn/Colonialism-Database
10. Need to edit Apache's httpd.conf to load django webframe
