This document is a work in progress.  I'm hoping to keep adding more information on how to get the CLIO website up and running.

Software
--------
This website requires:

1. postgreSQL
2. Python
3. Django
4. PostGIS

Data
----
A backup of the current CLIO data is available at: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2474433/clio.backup

Django Code
-----------
The actual code used for the website is located in the "colonialismdb" folder.  Two this are needed:

1. Copy local_settings.py.sample to local_settings.py and modify it according to your local settings (in particular the TODO parts)
2. Use local_manage.py instead of manage.py 
3. See what apps and middleware you need in settings.py
